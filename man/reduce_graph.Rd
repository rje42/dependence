\title{Reduce for a chosen set of target variables}
\usage{
reduce_graph(graph, B, w)

reduce_graph2(graph, v, w, pref)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a \code{mixedgraph} object.}

\item{B}{set of vertices for directed edges to converge on}

\item{w}{(optionally) an additional parent vertex of the intrinsic closure
of \code{B} for when it consists of a single vertex.}

\item{v, w}{two vertices w.r.t. which we wish to reduce the graph}
}
\description{
Reduce for a chosen set of target variables
}
\details{
\code{reduce_graph} implements application of Proposition 5.2 from
Evans (2021) to
obtain a smaller graph with respect to which perfect dependence between
two variables is still possible.

\code{reduce_graph2} implements Algorithm 1 to obtain a minimal subgraph of
the output from \code{reduce_graph}.
